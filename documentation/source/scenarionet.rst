`ScenarioNet <https://metadriverse.github.io/scenarionet/>`_ is a scenario database management system tightly coupled with MetaDrive.
It provides tools for converting Waymo, nuScenes, nuPlan, Argoverse and other driving data into the format that can be
read by MetaDrive simulator.
In this way, thousands of scenarios can be reconstructed in MetaDrive for various machine learning applications.
