Decision Intelligence Platform for Autonomous Driving simulation.

**DI-drive** is an open-sourece application platform under **OpenDILab**.
**DI-drive** applies Deep Learning method to decision, planning and controlling task in Autonomous Driving simulation,
with **high ease of use** and **low difficulty to hands-on**.
**DI-drive** designes **Casezoo** to make simulation environment closer to real driving.
**DI-drive** develops Deep Learning driving policy with `Pytorch <http://pytorch.org>`_ and `DI-engine <https://github.com/opendilab/DI-engine>`_
and supports `Carla <http://carla.org>`_ and `MetaDrive <https://metadriverse.github.io/metadrive>`_ simulator.
