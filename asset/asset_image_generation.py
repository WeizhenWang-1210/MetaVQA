"""
This script go over annotated 3D models from GLB files and generates images based.
It reads configuration settings to define the paths for the JSON and GLB directories.
For each annotated JSON file, it extracts model information and filters specific types.
It then loads the corresponding GLB file,
checks if it's a Scene or a Mesh, and takes a screenshot of the loaded 3D model.
The screenshot is saved in a specified output folder with a constructed filename based on
the model's general and detail type information.
The script is particularly designed to handle special cases such as car models differently.
